# odin-rock-paper-scissors
A rock-paper-scissors project from The Odin Project

The game finish audio is made by me, all other sounds are from freesound.org and have been credited on the page.

This was the result of my (head-)first dive into DOM-manipulation with javascript, there are probably quite a few quirks and ways of doing things that don't follow "standard" procedure, due to me finding workarounds using my current knowledge. Although it's just a silly rock, paper scissors game, i had a lot of fun designing it and i think i learnt a lot and refreshed a lot of knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript.

If you turboclick it will most likely break due to the audio not resetting.
